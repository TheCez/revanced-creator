### options

#### using custom apk

here is how to patch user downloaded reddit apk\
(!) if apk_filename is not set, script uses find to select an apk from the directory you are in randomly(if there is only one apk in the directory you are in it is fine)\
(?) output_apk is optional

```sh
$ export what_to_patch="custom"
$ export apk_filename=reddit.apk
$ export output_apk=revanced-reddit.apk
$ ./patch.sh
```

#### additional_args

we include `enable-wide-searchbar` and `swipe-controls` patch and exclude `hide-shorts-button` here

```sh
$ export additional_args="-i enable-wide-searchbar -i swipe-controls -e hide-shorts-button"
$ ./patch.sh
```

#### what_to_patch(youtube, youtube-music, reddit or twitter)

```sh
$ export what_to_patch="youtube-music"
$ ./patch.sh
```

#### output_apk

you can set output apk name with this

```

#### apk_version(defaults to latest)

**To see versions available see the releases section**

```sh
$ export apk_version=17.27.39
$ ./patch.sh

#### root(defaults to 0)

#### downloader

aria2, axel, curl, wget; they are detected in this order and the first detected is used

```sh
$ export downloader="axel -n 16"
